# 📘 Introduction

Bellabeat is a wellness tech company helping women build healthy habits using smart devices. We analyzed public Fitbit data to uncover user activity and sleep patterns and recommend features for the Bellabeat app.

# 📂 Data Preparation

```{r setup, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)

# Load datasets (adjust path if needed)
daily_activity <- read_csv("dailyActivity_merged.csv")
sleep_day <- read_csv("sleepDay_cleaned.csv")
hourly_steps <- read_csv("hourlySteps_merged.csv")
```

# Join activity and sleep data

```{r}
activity_sleep <- left_join(daily_activity, sleep_day,
                            by = c("Id" = "Id", "ActivityDate" = "SleepDay"))
```

# INSIGHT 1: When Are Users Most Active?

```{r}
hourly_steps <- hourly_steps %>%
  mutate(ActivityHour = mdy_hms(ActivityHour),
         Hour = hour(ActivityHour))

steps_by_hour <- hourly_steps %>%
  group_by(Hour) %>%
  summarize(avg_steps = mean(StepTotal, na.rm = TRUE))

# Plot
ggplot(steps_by_hour, aes(x = Hour, y = avg_steps)) +
  geom_col(fill = "#FA8072") +
  labs(title = "When Are Users Most Active?",
       subtitle = "Average Steps by Hour of the Day",
       x = "Hour of Day (24h Format)", y = "Average Steps")
```

# INSIGHT 2: Sedentary Time vs Sleep Duration

```{r}
ggplot(activity_sleep, aes(x = SedentaryMinutes, y = TotalMinutesAsleep)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6, color = "#FA8072") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "#5C3D42") +
  labs(title = "Sedentary Time vs Sleep Duration",
       subtitle = "Does being sedentary affect how long users sleep?",
       x = "Sedentary Minutes per Day",
       y = "Total Minutes Asleep")
```

# INSIGHT 3: Activity Intensity vs Calories Burned

```{r}
activity_intensity <- daily_activity %>%
  select(Id, ActivityDate, VeryActiveMinutes, FairlyActiveMinutes, LightlyActiveMinutes, Calories) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(VeryActiveMinutes, FairlyActiveMinutes, LightlyActiveMinutes),
               names_to = "IntensityLevel", values_to = "Minutes")
```

```{r}
ggplot(activity_intensity, aes(x = Minutes, y = Calories, color = IntensityLevel)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Activity Intensity vs Calories Burned",
       subtitle = "Which level of activity contributes most to calorie burn?",
       x = "Minutes per Day", y = "Calories Burned")
```



# INSIGHT 4: Percentage of Low-Step Days (\< 5,000 Steps)

```{r}
activity_sleep_clean <- activity_sleep %>%
  filter(!is.na(TotalSteps))

print("Number of rows after removing NA TotalSteps:")
print(nrow(activity_sleep_clean))

low_step_days <- activity_sleep_clean %>%
  filter(TotalSteps < 5000)

low_step_count <- nrow(low_step_days)
print("Low step days:")
print(low_step_count)

total_days <- nrow(activity_sleep_clean)
print("Total valid days:")
print(total_days)

percentage_low_steps <- round((low_step_count / total_days)* 100,1)
print("Percentage of days with < 5000 steps:")
print(percentage_low_steps)

paste0("Users logged less than 5,000 steps on ", percentage_low_steps, "% of recorded days.")
```

# INSIGHT 5: Weekly Balance of Activity and Sleep

```{r}
activity_sleep_weekday <- activity_sleep %>%
  filter(!is.na(TotalSteps), !is.na(TotalMinutesAsleep)) %>%
  mutate(weekday = weekdays(ActivityDate)) %>%
  group_by(weekday) %>%
  summarize(avg_steps = mean(TotalSteps),
            avg_sleep = mean(TotalMinutesAsleep))
```

```{r}
activity_sleep_weekday$weekday <- factor(activity_sleep_weekday$weekday, 
                                         levels = c("Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"))
```

# Dual-axis plot (separate plots recommended in R)

```{r}
ggplot(activity_sleep_weekday, aes(x = weekday)) +
  geom_col(aes(y = avg_steps), fill = "#FA8072") +
  geom_line(aes(y = avg_sleep * 20), group = 1, color = "#5C3D42", size = 1.2) +
  scale_y_continuous(
    name = "Avg Steps",
    sec.axis = sec_axis(~./20, name = "Avg Sleep (mins)")
  ) +
  labs(title = "Balance of Activity & Sleep by Weekday",
       subtitle = "Steps (bars) and Sleep (line)",
       x = "Weekday")
```

# Final Recommendations

#### Send motivational messages during peak hours (5–8 PM)

#### Suggest movement breaks when sedentary time exceeds 60 minutes

#### Recommend short high-intensity workouts

#### Reward streaks when users hit 5,000+ steps daily

#### Offer a weekly “Balance Score” combining sleep + activity

# Conclusion

#### This case study uses real Fitbit data to deliver data-driven feature ideas for the Bellabeat app. It highlights the power of behavioral analysis in building healthier habits through thoughtful digital nudges.
